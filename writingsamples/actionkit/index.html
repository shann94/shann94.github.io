<h4>Situation Analysis: Year 3 EcoCAR3 HEVT</h4><p>By Tori Avvenire, Sarah Harvey, Carina Kang, Quan Ngo,<br> Shannon O’Dowd, John O’Grady and Mark Sewell</p></div></div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-1"></div>
  <div class="col-md-10">
    <h4>Public Relations Problem</h4>
    <p>The problem that persists based on the findings of EcoTech’s research is that consumers are not buying hybrid electric vehicles in the sport model or hybrid electric power vehicles such as trucks and SUVs. The Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team, and the other universities participating in EcoCAR3 are turning a muscle sports car, the Chevrolet Camaro, into a fully functioning hybrid electric vehicle. </p>
    <p>The technology exists and consumers are unaware of the capabilities of that technology. Engineering has advanced to create hybrid electric sports cars with the same power and abilities of the standard model, but creates a smaller carbon footprint. However, the public relations problem that exists here is that that information is not clear to consumers. As a result, consumers are missing out on opportunities to reduce their personal carbon footprint and save money on gas purchases. </p>
    <h4>History of EcoCAR3</h4>
    <p>EcoCAR3 is the most recent three year collegiate Advanced Vehicle Technology Competition (AVTC) series sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and General Motors (GM). The premier automotive engineering competition features 16 universities across North America.Those universities are:</p>
    <ul><li>Arizona State University</li>
    <li>California State University - Los Angeles</li>
    <li>Colorado State University</li>
    <li>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</li>
    <li>Georgia Tech</li>
    <li>McMaster University</li>
    <li>Mississippi State University</li>
    <li>Ohio State University</li>
    <li>Pennsylvania State University</li>
    <li>University of Alabama</li>
    <li>University of Tennessee - Knoxville </li>
    <li>University of Washington</li>
    <li>University of Waterloo</li>
    <li>Virginia Tech</li>
    <li>Wayne State University</li>
    <li>West Virginia University</li></ul>
    <p>EcoCAR “is the heart of American automotive ingenuity and innovation and is the ultimate training ground for minting future automotive leaders” (EcoCAR3 2014). The teams are given four years (2014-2018) to enhance a Chevrolet Camaro by applying the latest cutting-edge technologies and incorporating new innovative ideas. </p>
    <p>Universities fund their efforts with the aid of sponsors, which provide hardware, software, training, and support to the collegiate teams. The enables students to have access to the latest technology despite those technologies being too expensive. Sponsors can choose to be a contributor, supporter, sustaining, leadership, or visionary sponsor. Sponsors include, but are not limited to: MathWorks, National Science Foundation, DOE Clean Cities, AVL, Bosch, Siesmens, TRC, Denso, Woodward, Mentor Automotive, and Vector. </p>
<h4>Key Publics</h4>
<p>Internal:</p>
  <ul><li>Virginia Tech Engineering Department</li>
    <li>Virginia Tech Communication Department</li>
    <li>Virginia Tech Registered Student Organizations</li>
    <li>Virginia Tech Student Body</li></ul>
<p>External</p>
  <ul><li>Shelor Motor Mile Car Dealerships</li>
    <li>Residents of the New River Valley Area</li>
    <li>Virginia Legislatures</li></ul>
<h4>SWOT Analysis</h4>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<ul><li>Hybrid Cars are growing in population/popularity</li>
  <li>Growing popularity for schools to compete in EcoCAR </li>
  <li>Large and reputable sponsors (GM and US Department of Energy) </li>
  <li>Virginia Tech has a large alumni group </li>
  <li>Strong faculty involvement with the HEVT program </li>
  <li>Has Social Media to reach public</li>
  <li>Students can see the car being worked on campus </li>
  <li>Known for being a top engineering school means more school recognition compared to some other involved schools</li></ul>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
  <ul><li>Geographic location of Virginia Tech is not ideal for hybrid electric vehicle technology because of mountain terrain and unpredictable weather patterns </li>
    <li>Not much newspaper coverage (local or collegiate) in recent competition  </li>
    <li>Website does not contain any informational and/or entertaining videos that might help increase public awareness and interest in EcoCAR </li>
    <li>SEO does not reflect current competition</li>
    <li>College students can't afford to buy cars, especially at the price of Hybrid Electric vehicles, on their own</li></ul>
<p>Opportunities:</p>
<ul><li>Increase social media presence outside of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. HEVT should consider adding a LinkedIn and/or Flickr </li>
  <li>Partner with different Virginia Tech college departments </li>
  <li>Reach out to more collegiate and local news outlets to gain more attention </li>
  <li>Performance vehicle being used in EcoCAR 3</li>
  <li>Campus awareness</li>
  <li>Student organization involvement</li>
  <li>Student resume building</li>
  <li>Targeting young women because they will eventually grow into the middle aged women that are supposedly the main buyers of hybrid cars</li>
  <li>Gas prices are always fluctuating, the price of oil recently increases so more people could be leaning towards buying hybrid electric vehicles</li></ul>
<p>Threats:</p>
<ul><li>General lack of knowledge/negative stigma toward hybrid vehicles</li>
  <li>Low percentage of population interested in purchasing hybrid vehicles</li>
  <li>Decreasing gas prices; increased US oil production</li>
  <li>Lack of knowledge about diversity of Hybrid technology </li></ul>
<h4>Goals and Objectives</h4>
<p>GOAL: Change the cultural stigmas that accompany the ideals of a hybrid electric vehicle. Typically, hybrid electric vehicles are viewed as a car for women. However, hybrid electric vehicles are capable of being strong performance cars that surpass the competition. </p>
<ul><li>Objective 1: Increase the amount of male buyers by 20% in the NRV area by the end of the model year. According to advertising research done by Elizabeth Hirschman, men are typically interested in driving powerful cars, such as sports performance vehicles (2003). With Chevy making moves to prove that hybrid electric vehicles can also be powerful cars, like the standard Camaro, HEVT’s performance can boost awareness and interest in the purchase of hybrid electric vehicles among men.</li>
<li>Objective 2: Increase Virginia Tech student awareness by 30% by the end of the 2016-2017 school year. Today’s college students are tomorrow’s leaders who eventually, if they haven’t already, need to buy a car of their own. Planting the seed in the mind of the student body will not only boost awareness of HEVT’s efforts, but can also convince students that they can buy hybrid electric vehicles without sacrificing performance. Additionally, increasing awareness can, in turn, increase campus involvement in HEVT.</li>
<li>Objective 3: Increase the sale of sport hybrid electric vehicles in the NRV area by 40% by the end of Year 4 in the EcoCar3 competition. With the technology available to create sport hybrid electric vehicles that are just as powerful as their standard counterparts, the cars should be selling more than they do. EcoTech’s research has found that the sport edition of hybrid cars do not sell nearly as much as the standard hybrid model or the standard non-hybrid model. This exists because of misconceptions of what is means to be a hybrid car, which can be correction with good public relations messages.</li></ul>
