<br><p>Dear Mr. Davis:</p>
<p>Route One Apparel allows people to express their Maryland state pride through their clothing and accessories because clothing is the best way to express oneself. Route One Apparel is holding its first annual "Route One Apparel's Statement Contest" Saturday Dec. 6 at the University Union building at Towson University in Towson, Maryland at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>The winner of "Route One Apparel's Statement Contest" will receive a $150 gift card to Route One Apparel and a pair of tickets to an upcoming Baltimore Orioles game. Runner up with receive a $75 gift card to Route One Apparel. People of all are welcome to compete and must register online at www.routeoneapparel.com by Nov. 29. There is a $10 registration fee.</p>

<p>The contest will feature two parts. The first part is a fashion show where contestants are given the opportunity to show off their best Maryland pride outfits. The second part is a Q and A where the three judges will ask each contestant one question. The contestant is to answer in a way that will show their striking personality.</p>

<p>Contestants will be judged on their creativity, outfit, answer to the Q and A and, most importantly, Maryland state pride. The judges will determine a winner based on a point scale. Each category will be scored 1-10 by each judge. The contestant with the highest score is the winner. The three judges are founder and CEO of Route One Apparel, Ali von Paris, co-designer of the first Route One Apparel item, the "Turtle Survivor" penny, Janna Skinner, and owner of Kelsey's Kloset, Route One Apparel's newest retailer, Kelsey Kleinhin.</p>

<p>Route One Apparel is encouraging Marylanders to have pride in where they are from through expressive, bold clothing. Even if bold is not a specific buyer's interest, Route One Apparel produces clothing with symbols representing the beautiful Free State. Merchandise designs are based upon the Maryland Flag, Maryland products (National Bohemian and Old Bay Seasoning), Baltimore Ravens logo and colors, Baltimore Orioles logo and colors, and even designs for the Preakness Stakes held in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Paige Merchant, 22, is a born and raised Marylander. She attended public schools in the same county as the University of Maryland, Prince George's County. Having always been surrounded by UMD, she grew up a Terrapin, and even went to UMD for undergrad. "My mom bought me a UMD cheerleading outfit when I was 7-years-old," Merchant said, "I was a UMD cheerleader for Halloween every year until I outgrew it.""</p>
<p>Merchant says the wearing clothing and accessories from Route One Apparel is exciting for her. Merchant likes the wear Route One Apparel's clothes because she us proud of the state she is from. She looks forward to competing in "Route One Apparel's Statement Contest" because she knows she has the personality and pride.</p>
<p>Alec Johnson, 19, grew up in Maryland, as well. He, however, did not choose to attend UMD. Johnson is attending Virginia Tech, located in Blacksburg, Virginia, approximately four hours away from the Maryland boarder. Johnson is on the men's lacrosse team at Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>"I'm proud of where I am from and I love wearing the Maryland flag on my clothing because of this," Johnson said. "Also, the flag is like no other state's so it different, like me!" Johnson also says that other Maryland students at Virginia Tech approach him and he's met several friends because he wears Route One Apparel's clothing and accessories. Johnson is coming back to Maryland to compete in the contest.</p>
<p>"There's just something about Maryland that you can't find anywhere else," Ricky Thompson, 21, a former Maryland resident, said. Thompson moved to West Virginia from Maryland with his family when he was 16-years-old. He says he misses the Old Bay covered everything, Blue Crabs, and cheering on the Baltimore Orioles. Thompson says that he comes back to the Free State often to attend Orioles games and drink he favorite beer, a Maryland brew, National Bohemian.</p>
<p>"I entered the contest to show that although I don't still live in Maryland, I'm still a Marylander at heart," Thompson said. Thompson says that being a Marylander is a lifestyle: enjoy Old Bay Seasoning, crabs, and the state flag.<p>
