<div class="col-md-9"><br><h4>Retirees Provided Opportunites for Life Long Learning</h4>

<p>Release Date: Sept. 18, 2014</p></div></div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12"><p>Athens, Ga - Life for retired electrical engineer, Bob Schieman, has been full of learning and social opportunities thanks to the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Georgia (OLLI at UGA.)Schieman has enjoyed the challenge of a variety of courses including courses on computers at OLLI at UGA. "As an engineer I never had to type on the computers because I had a secretary," Schieman said. "Now there is no one to call to type my letters or to helpme, so the computer classes have been challenging."</p>

<p>Ruth Webb has taken full advantage of her free time after retirement by activelybeing involved in OLLI at UGA's programs. Webb, a retired reference librarian, has been a member of Athens area LIR-now OLLI at UGA-since its beginnings in 1994.</p>

<p>Webb's peers call her an activist because she is involved in several committees on top of being an avid traveler and taking courses including a course on lighthouses. She is on the social committee and the curriculum committee which is in charge of determining what courses to offer at OLLI at UGA. She is thankful she was blessed with parents committed to learning and traveling and wishes to continue to carry on that ideal.</p>

<p>Traveling, however, is not in the future plans of OLLI at UGA member, Edna Johnson. After traveling with her husband to Cambodia and India, Johnson has settled in Athens, Georgia. Having heard about this organization through a mailing, Johnson has enjoyed taking courses and recruiting friends. Although some of her friends are too young or old, she has made plenty of friends in classes.</p>

<p>Johnson also had the opportunity to facilitate her own poetry class out of her home. The course had a limit of 10 students and Johnson taught using her poetry books at home. She enjoys Edna St. Vincent Millay's work the most. Johnson wishes she could participate more, but she continues to attend OLLI at UGA to keep her mind sharp.</p>

<p>The Bernard Osher Foundation made a grant to Learning in Retirement Inc. (LIR) for the purpose of improving the education programs for seniors originally created by the organization.</p>

<p>The conditions of the grant were for LIR to reach 500 members. On Feb. 16, 2014 the Bernard Osher Foundation made a grant to Learning in Retirement, changing the name to the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Georgia.</p>

<p>Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at the University of Georgia (OLLI at UGA) is committed to encouraging lifelong learning by dedicating itself to meeting the intellectual, social and cultural needs of mature adults. Offering nearly 250 courses every year in a subjects including literature, religion, Tai Chi, food and wine, philosophy and both natural and social sciences, OLLI at UGA is the best place for mature adults to continue education.</p>

<p>There are over 1,200 members that take part in the travel and study opportunities across the state and globe. There is always room for eager education seekers.</p>

<p>The Bernard Osher Foundation, headquartered in San Francisco, was founded in 1977 by Bernard Osher, a respected businessman and community leader. The Foundation seeks to improve quality of life through support for higher education and the arts.</p>

<p>More information about OLLI at UGA is available online at www.olli.uga.org or by contacting Shannon O’Dowd by email at shann94@vt.edu or by phone at 301-555-5555. Additional information on the Bernard Osher Foundation can be found online at www.osherfoundation.org.</p></div></div>
