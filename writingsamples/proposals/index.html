<div class="col-md-4"><br><br><h4>Public Health Press Release Writing - Report Proposal</h4></div></div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12"><br><p><strong>Background/Introduction</strong><br>

At some point in my career post graduation, I want to get paid to write press releases for a health company like the National Hearth, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institute of Health (NIH.) NIH is a government agency that seeks fundamental knowledge on nature and the behavior of living systems in addition to the application of such information. The agency’s goals are to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce disability. At NIH there are several different institutes, one being the NHLBI.</p>

<p>NHLBI provides research, training, and educational programs to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lungs, and lung diseases. At NHLBI there is the Office of Communications that is located in Bethesda Maryland. Here, the public relations professionals are responsible for many things, one of those things being writing press releases.</p>

<p>Being a public relations major, I have already written a few press releases for previous class and internships. I understand the mechanics and the importance of press releases. Press releases are written in Associated Press style, they are timely, news worthy, report on positive information or are a response to an event, and they are written towards a target audience. There are many different types of press releases—feature pitch, feature article, news release.</p>

<p>I would like to study this genre of professional writing because I want to be a public relations professional in the public health field. Doing research on this genre will prepare me for the future career that I will have. This is not imaginary or a potential side job, this is the genre of professional writing that will be my career. </p>

<p><strong>Areas to be Studied</strong><br>

<p>During my research I will be answering questions pertaining to the importance of professional writing in the public health field. I will research not only the mechanics of press release writing, but the environment, the audience, timeliness, and the content of press release writing.</p>

<p><strong>Specific questions include:</strong><p>

<ol><li>Where is a press release published?</li>
<li>Who is the audience of a press release?</li>
<li>Where is a press release written?</li>
<li>Who cares about press releases</li>
<li>What is the purpose of a press release?</li>
<li>How many authors are there?</li>
<li>Where is it relevant?</li>
<li>What is its impact?</li></ol>
<p>I intend to acquire an in-depth understand of the type of professional writing I intend to make a living out of. The goal is to have enough information so that I rarely have to ask questions about my future job.</p>

<p><strong>Methods of Research</strong><br>

I have an interview scheduled with the president of communications at the Maryland Jockey Club on 25 Nov. 2014. The purpose of the interview is to ask questions about their job and their relationship with the media. I will ask additional questions pertaining to press release writing. The questions include:</p>

<ol><li>What is his method of writing?</li>
<li>What is your writing process?</li>
<li>How often does he write press releases?</li>
<li>Are there more response press releases or good new press releases?</li></ol>

<p>I will use press releases from NHLIB to conduct further research on this area of professional writing. I will analyze the similarities and differences between the articles to gain a better understanding of what the communication department of the NHLIB is looking to promote in their press releases.</p>

<p>Most of my research will be through database articles using the Virginia Tech library. I will be searching for articles on the big picture of press release writing and narrowing my search to answer questions that are not answered.<p>

<p>Lastly, I will use my textbook, Public Relations Writing and Media Techniques by Dennis L. Wilcox and Bryan H. Reber. This textbook is from Dr. Cayce Myers' Writing and Editing in Public Relations class at Virginia Tech.</p>

<p><strong>Timetable</strong><br>

<p>I plan to have library research completed by the end of October. However, since I am actively taking Writing and Editing in Public Relations, I have already completed some research for this assignment. This research will include my evaluation of press releases from the NHLIB. I will do a thorough analysis and compare those press releases to that of a press release from profit based companies.</p>

<p>The weeks leading up to Thanksgiving break, I will conduct research on the audience of press releases for NHLIB. I have a few predictions on the audience-the target audience is broad for online press release publications or the target audience is health professionals. Whatever the case, I will use this time to examine their existing knowledge, their experience with lung, heart, and blood research, their motivations for reading such press releases and what they do with the information provided.</p>

<p>While on Thanksgiving break, I will attempt to work immediately after the interview, which is on 25 Nov. 2014, to ensure that I remember as much as I can since the deadline is quickly approaching. I will record the interview, but I would prefer to put everything together while it is fresh in my mind.</p>

<p>Since my interview is so late in November, the overall process is to write my report as I go, collecting and writing down as much information as possible-word vomit. During Thanksgiving break, I will organize, edit, and cut information appropriately.</p>

<p>I plan to complete the report on Saturday, 29 Nov. 2014. I will continue the editing and revising process up until the due date, 2 Dec. 2014. On top of continuing to edit my report, I will be preparing a presentation that is five minutes in length. All work will be completed by Monday, 1 Dec. 2014. Regardless of the date I am to present, it is best to be prepared for the first date.</p>

<p><strong>Qualifications</strong><br>

I already have an existing knowledge of the subject of public relations and press release writing. I have no only analyzed press releases in the past, I have professionally and academically written a few. On the academic ones, I have received high marks. In the ear of health, I am pursuing a minor in biological sciences. I have the biological background to be efficient in a public health job.</p>

<p>Additionally, this is not just the subject I want to get paid to do, it is what I am going to get paid to do. I will graduate with a degree in public relations and go into a corporate job where I will be writing press releases for a living. After establishing my credibility and skill at the corporate job, I plan to move on to a job in the public health field, preferable NHLBI, utilizing the information from this research paper and the experience at the corporate job.</p>

<p>I am thorough with my research; I do not settle for anything less than 100 percent. Additionally, I always give a project my all, especially when it pertains so much to my future.</p>

<p><strong>Request for Approval</strong><br>

I am requesting approval for my public health press release report. My only concerns at this point is formulating and organizing all the information needed to produce an excellent report. There are a lot of areas to cover on this report; I wish to be able to keep track of everything so that nothing is missing.</p></div></div>
