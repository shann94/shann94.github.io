<div class="col-md-1"></div></div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-1"></div>
  <div class="col-md-10"><br><h4>Problem Summary</h4>

<p>Every 10 minutes a name is added to the national organ transplant waiting list. This name will be added to the list of over 123,000 Americans who are waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant (Donate Life n.d.). Increasing awareness for organ donation is vital for correcting misconceptions and increasing social acceptance of organ and bone marrow donation.</p>

<p>While there are over a million Americans registered as organ donors, there is still an average of  21 individuals dying each day waiting for their organ donation (Donate Life n.d.). Organ donation registry is denied by 38% of licensed drivers whose top concerns revolve around religious beliefs, their health status, and an overall reluctance to trust doctors (Oliver 2010). Our aim in creating a campaign around organ donation is to establish an open mindset toward being a donor and increase the amount of registered students on Virginia Tech’s campus by 10%.</p>

<h4>Target Behaviors and Intermediate Responses</h4>

<p>Our target behavior is for students at Virginia Tech to become registered organ donors. We will be doing this through focusing on changing misconceptions about organ donation in order to allow students to have an unbiased and open attitude towards the topic. We seek to influence those individuals who have never researched or given thought about organ donation. Gaining the understanding of what it means to be an organ donor is pivotal in changing behavior. Many people hear organ donation and assume they understand what it entails. Some automatically register with no research and others refuse the idea without finding the exact risks. </p>

<p>By providing organ donation facts to members of Virginia Tech, the team is targeting the intermediate responses of general awareness and student beliefs toward the topic. While we do not plan to use guilt methods for those who do not intend to be organ downers, we do want to explain and emphasise the severity of the choice to give or withhold organs. We do not want to make our target feel bad for disagreeing or perpetuate negative feelings about donation. The idea is to create an open mind, spread truthful facts, and create an opportunity to change. </p>

<p>We saw the use of positive emotional pulls through Donate Life’s 2012  campaign “20 million in 2012”  to increase registration. This campaign reached its goal through sharing youth transplant success stories with their audience.  They used the emotional appeal of saving a life and showing all the patient had accomplished since their transplant. The emotion was always positive, thankful, and successful. Donate Life focused on how to move its audience to register with altruistic feelings. Similar to Donate Life, this campaign asks students to learn about donation, consider the possibility,  and make the choice themselves. The idea is to create an open mind, spread truthful facts, and create an opportunity to change their attitude through increased awareness. </p>

<h4>Campaign Objectives</h4>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Supply the facts and increase awareness of the truth about organ donation among Virginia Tech undergraduate and graduate students</p>


<ul><li><strong>Objective 1: Increase the number of legally registered organ donors on Virginia Tech’s campus by 10% by December 31, 2016.</strong> We will be able to roughly estimate the current number of registered organ donors based on the sampling collected from our survey results. An increase in organ donors shows that Virginia Tech students were provided and understood the correct facts and made a personal decision to become organ donors.</li>
<li><strong>Objective 2: Have the campaign’s website reach 10,000 visits by December 31, 2016.</strong> Through the website platform that we will use, we can monitor the traffic of visitors on the page. As more people visit the webpage, the awareness of our campaign increases as a result.</li>
<li><strong>Objective 3: Distribute 10,000 table cards by the end of the 2015-2016 academic year.</strong> The team will design table cards that will present students with the myths and falsify those myths with correct facts about organ donation. The table card will be readable and interactive. These table cards will be distributed in Squires, on the Drillfield, and in front of Lavery Hall.</li></ul>

<h4>Audience Analysis</h4>

<p>IThe intended audience of this campaign message is Virginia Tech undergraduate and graduate students. In order to develop messages, the team needs to know what the general opinion about organ donation is among those students, whether it be a general misunderstanding about the logistics of organ donation or if Virginia Tech students understand what being an organ donor means.</p>

<p>Through the team’s survey research, the characteristics of the audience will become clear and the messages can be developed to fit that demographic’s needs. There are more females than males enrolled in college programs, 2.7 million more according to a 2012 study. Since 2006, more and more people are attending college unrelated to ethnic background. Most college students, however, are non-Hispanic white individuals in the 18-24 age range. Lastly, cost of attending college is the number one factor that determines a college student’s academic career.</p>

<p>According to research done by Denisha Champion and her research team, college students care about their personal health with respect to physical fitness. There is a small increase for mental health care and less of an increase for healthy diets (Champion et al. 2015). Additionally, according to research by Terrill Bravender, less than half of college students feel that they cannot manage disabilities in additionally to their collegiate responsibilities (Bravender 2014). </p>

<p>As far as behaviors, most college students do not smoke (Dunn 2015). Religion and spirituality influence sexual behaviors, though most college students are sexual active (Luquis et al 2012). As for drinking, 1 in 4 students don’t drink alcohol; those that do drink, engage in binge drinking at least once a week. Drinking behaviors among college students are influenced most by same-sex peers (Lewis et al 2004).</p>

<h4>Segmentation</h4>

<p>The large audience of Virginia Tech college students can be broken down into four segments based on meaningful criteria. The segmentation technique of use is motivation or constraint variables that influence behavior. This technique is being used over demographic information to segment because there is little correlation because organ donation and demographic information other than education level--which all Virginia Tech college students are either pursuing a undergraduate or graduate degree. Using the motivation technique will allow the message to be more applicable to each target group based upon their pre-existing feelings about organ donation.</p>

<p>The first subgroup is people who are organ donors. A second group is people who are not organ donors, but not by choice and need more information. A third group is people who are not organ donors, but are interested in become organ donors. The final group is people who are not organ donors by choice.
</p>

<h4>Channels</h4>

<p>We have decided that our message will be best delivered through digital media, more specifically the development of a campaign website.  Specific details of what information will be included on the campaign website can be found in Project Design.  In light of the fact that our key audiences are Virginia Tech undergraduate and graduate students, we have identified that our digital media campaign website is best distributed through an interpersonal channel.  We plan to take advantage of our own networks as well as Virginia Tech’s pre-established digital following to share our campaign website page on:</p>
<ul><li>Virginia Tech Class of 20XX Facebook pages</li>
<li>Virginia Tech Twitter </li>
<li>Face-to-face</li>
<li>Campaign website</li>
<li>Public Service Announcement (PSA)</li></ul>


<p>We believe the digital media and mass media channels are most appropriate and will yield the greatest reach based on the audience we are trying to reach.</p>

<h4>Theoretical Perspective</h4>

<p><ol><li><strong>Diffusion of Innovation Theory:</strong> relates to our campaign concerning Organ Donation as we attempt to target the 18-22 year-old student population of Virginia Tech. Trendiness and perception of what others think play a large role in collegiate society. As students are away from the influences of parents they also tend to explore alternative beliefs and attitudes. We believe that innovators and early adopters here are those individuals who chose to register as an organ donor at their first opportunity; upon receiving their driver's license. We aim to target the early majority into registering. These are the most likely to act at this stage of their life and are still slightly prone to be swayed by social norms. By understanding how others act based on societal norms the team can better target those most willing to change. </li>

<li><strong>Third-Person Effect Theory:</strong> directly points out to us why people may shy away from donation. At ages 18-22 years old, unless personally affected, most students to do not spend frequent time researching and understanding organ donations. They instead absorb outside opinions as their own beliefs. As stated in the third-person effect, students are not likely to believe they are susceptible to persuasive messages from news, TV, and other media outlets. Dramatic fictional shows that portray false information about organ donation can hold more effect than most admit to. By knowing this our team can better combat false facts and bring awareness to truth behind organ donation. </li>

<li><strong>Social Exchange Theory:</strong> explains that society thinks relationships are only formed through give and take. Organ donation is not something borrowed or paid for; rather, it is a selfless gift. Understanding this theory helps us in two ways: to understand hesitance in donation and to understand the effect of altruistic feelings. Because the donor is not receiving anything from their donation, in living or post-mortem donations, they often do not understand why they would want to register. Common thoughts include their personal need of the organ, if the person receiving the organ is a worthy candidate, and if their personal medical care would be tampered with. However, this theory also explains why giving an organ with the knowledge that you can never be repaid is enticing. Never gaining anything in return proves that the individual has overcome societal norms. These altruistic motivations are important to understand for persuasive techniques. </li></ol>

<h4>Project Design</h4>

<p>As previously mentioned, we will be developing a campaign website dedicated to the distribution of information on the organ donation process.  An outline of the website’s structure is as follows:</p>
<ol><li><strong>Home:</strong> The Home portion will display our campaign’s overall message and goal statement.  It will be laid out in a simple and straightforward way to lead visitors towards the information they are seeking.</li>
  <li><strong>The Facts:</strong> This tab will supply visitors with all the facts in regards to organ donation.  We will incorporate the information from the 12 journals and sources we’ve developed our campaign around, and deliver the facts simply and concisely.  The overall goal of our site is to educate the public on the facts - both positive and negative -  behind the organ donation process.</li>
  <li><strong>Why Donate:</strong> The Why Donate section is where we will incorporate our PSA as well as personal stories and testimonials.</li>
  <li>How you can Help:</strong> We recognize that their are many situations in which individuals want to help the cause but are not personally eligible - whether it be for medical or other reasons - to donate their organs.  How You Can Help will detail just that: the ways in which individuals can join our efforts to educate the public on organ donation.</li>
  <li><strong>Become a Donor:</strong> This tab will be a sub-tab of the How You Can Help section.  It will go into detail about how an individual can register to become an organ donor.  All FAQs in regards to the process will be listed here. We recognize that Virginia Tech students, and other who may come across our site, are not strictly residents of Virginia and therefore will have for each respective state listed.</li>
  <li><strong>Materials and Resources:</strong> This tab will display information for visitors to contact the site’s developers. It will also have links to prevalent organization’s sites such as Donate Life National Organ Donor Registry, in case visitors would like more information on the topic.</li></ol>
<p>Additionally, a table card will be designed to provide students with the myths and the correct facts about organ donation. This will promote awareness about organ donation in the hopes to discredit the negative social norms. This will take a rational approach to providing information. The team will use Adobe InDesign to design the table card for dissemination. </p>

<p>Lastly, a PSA will be developed showcasing the positive effects of organ donation. The PSA will be about a Virginia Tech student who received an organ--testimonial. The PSA will deliver factual information about how organ donation saves lives. It will use emotional appeals to evoke change. The PSA will be posted on the campaign’s webpage.</p>
