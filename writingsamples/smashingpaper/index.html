  <h3>ATOM V. DREAMWEAVER: DAWN OF HTML CODING</h3>
  <p>If there is one thing I have learned in my college career maneuvering through the Communication and English Department at Virginia Tech, there are several ways to do one thing. This can be applied to one program (e.g., there’s many different ways to make text bold in Adobe InDesign) or one concept (e.g., coding for a website).</p>
  <p>When it comes to web design, one can use What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editors like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Adobe Dreamweaver</a> or code mode editors like <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. Today, you're going on a journey to uncover which editor is the right one for you based on the facts, rather than my opinion (although I will give my opinion at the end).</p>
  <h3>WYSIWYG <img src="dreamweaver.png" alt="Dreamweaver Logo" width="15%" height="15%"/></h3>
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> WYSIWYG editors are programs that have the ability to directly manipulate the layout of a document without typing or remember names of layout commands. Web designer, Julia Blake, wrote in <a href="http://tech.co/building-website-wysiwyg-editors-pros-cons-2015-02">&quot;Building a Website with WYSIWYG Editors: Pros and Cons,&quot;</a> &quot;This type of editing tool is fast, easy to manage, and immediately gratifying: you immediately see the result of the changes you apply to the website design.&quot;</p>
  <p>Essentially, there is no actual coding here; therefore, users do not understand the language of coding, but is that necessary if the user is not planning on becoming a web designer? Web designer, Jennifer Kyrnin, wrote in her article <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/cs/htmleditors/i/ai_whytext.htm">&quot;Pros and Cons of Text Editors,&quot;</a> &quot;The problem was (and often, still is) that WYSIWYG editors can generate HTML that is hard to read, not standards compliant and only really editable in that editor.&quot;</p>
  <p>However, for someone who is strictly into design, it is argued that WYSIWYG programs enables users to design with ease because their main goal is a &quot;visuals first&quot; design. It is not important to learn code because the design element is what is most important. A benefit of WYSIWYG editors is that elements can be manipulated and arranged with ease. This makes production of mobile pages easier to do. The production of a webpage is faster and instantly gratifying because the designer does not have to debate whether their code will work or not.</p>
  <p>Web designer, Joshua Johnson, argues against this in his article <a href="https://designshack.net/articles/software/why-adobe-doesnt-understand-web-designers/">&quot;Why Adobe Doesn’t Understand Web Designers&quot;</a>, &quot;The web... is built on interaction. The basic idea of the worldwide web as we now know it is that it’s an interactive portal to a global network. No matter how much current and former print designers, myself included, want it to be print design on a screen, that’s simply not the case. The web is a living breathing thing and print design metaphors taken too far are simply serving up dead, static content.&quot;</p>
  <p>In WYSIWYG programs, like Adobe Dreamweaver, the design of a webpage generates a HTML code for a webpage. The manipulation on the preview page changes the code on the coding page to ensure that the manipulation is saved. However, the code can be messier than if the webpage was coded by hand.</p>
  <h4>Pros of WYSIWYG</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Easier to use than code mode editors,</li>
  <li>Enables &quot;visual designers&quot; to design content without learning new skills. Designers can focus on design rather than asking &quot;does my code work?&quot;</li>
  <li>Fast; less time and effort spent,</li>
  <li>Users have more control,</li>
  <li>Immediately gratifying,</li>
  <li>WYSIWYG editors do generate code for future editing by a code designer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Cons of WYSIWYG</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Typically cost money, especially for those programs that are actually good,</li>
  <li>WYSIWYG editors can generate inaccurate code or the code is messy making ti harder to edit in the future,</li>
  <li>It is hard to move from one text editor to another (e.g., cannot move from Dreamweaver to Froala with ease),</li>
  <li>Web is an interactive place.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Code Mode <img src="atom.jpg" alt="Atom Logo" width="35%" height="35%" /></h3>
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Code mode editors are editing programs that enable users to write code using all the brackets and forward slashes the heart desires. If you plan on coding for a long time, this is probably the best place to start.</p>
  <p>Understanding how HTML code actually works enables you to see an error and be equipped with the skills to fix it quickly, rather than scanning 10,000 lines of code and not having a clue what you're looking for. Your coding skills will become more sharp over time when new experience arise. Shay Howe wrote in her HTML and CSS lesson titled, <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/performance-organization/">&quot;Performance and Organization,&quot;</a> &quot;As a website’s code base and traffic grows, a new skill set comes into play, one that is extremely important to both development time and user experience.&quot;</p>
  <p>Basically, if you want to do HTML coding for a living, you should probably know how code mode editors work and the HTML language. Yes, it's called a language, but it isn't as scary as it sounds. Expert web designer, Christopher Heng, wrote in his article titled, <a href="http://www.thesitewizard.com/html-tutorial/learning-html-vs-using-wysiwyg-web-editors.shtml">&quot;Should I Learn HTML or Just Use a WYSIWYG Web Editor? Pros and Cons of Using a Visual Web Editor vs Learning HTML&quot;</a> that, &quot;HTML is actually a very easy document formatting language to learn. It was deliberately designed that way. Even if you're an incidental webmaster, and not a computer geek, the language can usually be mastered by many people with little effort.&quot; Heng would be correct; the language is still in English, there is just a mix of symbols involved.</p>
  <p>Howe adds that it's time consuming to render a web page from scratch. However, she notes, &quot;Taking the time to design the right structure for a code base, and identify how all of the different components will work together, can speed up production and make for a better experience all around.&quot; So although it takes time, this process is better for the coder and the users. Additionally, with experience the process speeds up and the website will perform better.</p>
  <p><a href="http://webdesign.about.com/cs/htmleditors/i/ai_whytext.htm">Kyrnin</a> notes that some users of text editors claim that it is harder to design with code mode editors because they cannot see what the code actually looks like, compared to WYSIWYG editors. However, text editor applications, such as Atom, actually have a preview mode that enables the user to see the webpage as they are coding.</p>
  <p>Additionally, some editors have advanced as far as color coding different tags for what they represent. For example, in Atom the tag 'class' will appear orange when the file is saved as html. Another nice feature of code mode editors is files can be Markdown, HTML, txt, etc.</p>
  <h4>Pros of using code mode editors</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Being knowledgable in this skill boosts website performance</li>
  <li>Faster edits: fixing errors is a smoother process</li>
  <li>Typically free</li>
  <li>Many different applications to choose from</li>
  <li>Fluent in a new language</li>
  <li>Can save files in many different formats</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Cons</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Must know the HTML language to effectively use code mode editors,</li>
  <li>Takes time to initially code a web page,</li>
  <li>More difficult to &quot;design&quot; if using an application lacking a preview mode</li>
  <li>More complicated until user gets the hang of it</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Who's the Real Winner?</h3>
  <p><img src="codemode.png" alt="Code Mode" width="55%" height="55%"/> <br><em>That's right.</em> Not only is it the most frustrating, but it is the most rewarding. If you're looking to be successful web designer, you gotta know what your code means and what you're doing.</p>
  <p>My suggestion is this: if your interested in designing for a long time, learn code more. If you are designing a webpage for a very short period of time, use WYSIWYG editors. If you're unsure, starting learning code mode, but use WYSIWYG as a crutch. A mixture of the two will help with initial designs, but be sure you are not cheating yourself out of a valuable skill by leaning on WYSIWYG editors.</p>
